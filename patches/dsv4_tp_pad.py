"""DeepSeek-V4 TP padding for non-divisible tensor-parallel sizes (TP=3 on 3 Sparks).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
DeepSeek-V4-Flash has num_attention_heads=64 and o_groups=8. Neither divides by 3,
so vLLM refuses to start at TP=3 (`attention.py:183`) -- and, worse, silently
mis-shards the group axis (`attention.py:191`, `8 // 3 == 2`, no assert).

This module supplies the padding so a 3-node tensor-parallel deployment is legal
AND numerically identical to TP=1.

THE GROUP SEMANTICS (measured, not assumed)
-------------------------------------------
V4's o_proj is a per-group BMM:

    z = einsum("bhr,hdr->bhd", o, wo_a)     # h=group, r=hpg*head_dim, d=o_lora_rank
    out = wo_b(z.flatten(1))

Two candidate resolutions were tested against the REAL fp8 checkpoint weights
(`layers.3.attn.wo_a.weight`, [8192, 4096]):

  R2  pad groups 8 -> 24 (24 % 3 == 0), heads -> 72, hpg = 3.
      *** REJECTED -- arithmetically impossible. ***
      With G=24, each group slab needs width hpg*head_dim = 3*512 = 1536, but the
      checkpoint's slabs are 4096 wide. You cannot pad to a NARROWER tensor.
      Independently: a real 8-head group cannot split 3 ways (8/3 = 2.67).

  R1  replicate groups (n_local_groups = n_groups = 8), shard heads WITHIN each
      group. Pad heads-per-group 8 -> 9, so total heads = 8 * 9 = 72, and each
      rank takes 3 heads per group.
      *** CORRECT -- reproduces TP=1 at rel 2.3e-06 (fp8 e4m3 quantization noise). ***

The critical consequence of R1: wo_a's out-features stay G*o_lora_rank (they are
NOT divided by tp_size), so wo_b's input dim is unchanged and the all-reduce sums
exact per-rank partials. The padded 9th head in each group is zero and therefore
contributes exactly nothing.

Note the head count 72 also satisfies the naive rule `heads % (tp * o_groups) == 0`,
but for a DIFFERENT structural reason (9 heads per replicated group, not 24 padded
groups). Same number, different mechanism -- do not conflate them.

WHAT NOT TO DO
--------------
* Do NOT reuse GLM's `glm_wrapper_pad_backend_ok()`. It resolves against
  FLASHINFER_MLA_SPARSE_SM120, a backend DSv4 explicitly REJECTS
  (`nvidia/model.py:769-777`). Setting the correct backend env var would silently
  flip the pad value.
* Do NOT route `attn_sink` through GLM's `copy_tp_shard_with_pad()`. That helper
  calls `dest.zero_()` first; a zeroed sink lane means exp(0)=1, which adds a
  phantom unit to the softmax denominator and ATTENUATES REAL HEADS. Sink pad
  lanes must stay -inf. See `pad_fill_value()` below.
