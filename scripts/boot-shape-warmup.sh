# boot-shape-warmup.sh — burn spec-decode/prefill Triton shape buckets at boot.
#
# Why (issue #117): under live traffic, shapes that the single smoke request
# never materializes JIT-compile mid-serve. jit_monitor warns about the latency
# spike, but the real hazard on TP=2 is worse: a rank stalled in compilation
# leaves its peer waiting in a collective, and torch's ProcessGroupNCCL
# watchdog (600 s, NOT covered by VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS) kills
# the pair. Target kernel: _prepare_dflash_inputs_kernel. Its compile key is
#   BLOCK_SIZE = min(256, next_pow2(scheduled_tokens + 6))
# (+6 = 1 + num_speculative_tokens at the deployed num_speculative_tokens=5).
# Request concurrency does NOT enter this key at all, so the empirically live
# BLOCK keys {8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256} are reached only through exact
# scheduled-token counts s with next_pow2(s+6) = B — never through chat-batch
# concurrency (all our chat prompts land BLOCK 256), and the longchunk tail
# does not help either (~1342 tokens -> BLOCK 256, not a low bucket).
#
# Two mechanisms:
# - Bucket ladder: six plain POST /v1/completions requests whose prompts are
#   built to encode exactly s tokens, s = {1, 6, 20, 45, 100, 200}, mapping via
#   next_pow2(s+6) onto every live BLOCK key {8,16,32,64,128,256}. The
#   deployed tokenizer encodes 'hello' + (s-1)x' hello' as exactly s tokens,
#   but that heuristic is never trusted blindly: each rung is verified at
#   runtime with an authenticated POST /tokenize BEFORE its completion fires,
#   and any count mismatch fails the rung — and the nonfatal warmup — with a
#   precise, secret-free diagnostic instead of silently warming a wrong shape.
# - Chat arms C=1/2/4/6 (bounded by the launcher's resolved
#   --max-num-seqs) cover both bounded longer prompts and ordinary short
#   requests with client-default generation settings. Medium + multi-chunk
#   long prefill and one thinking-off arm cover other batch-keyed variants;
#   none of these arms contributes to the low buckets above.
# - Sampling arms (2026-08-24 incident follow-up): every arm above runs
#   greedy (temperature 0), so vllm/v1/sample/ops/topk_topp_triton.py's
#   _topk_topp_kernel — dispatched only when a request carries top_k and/or
#   top_p — was never warmed and JIT-compiled mid-serve (persistent-cache
#   entries born 15:26/15:27 UTC on a serving box prove it). The pinned
#   runtime's enumerable compile-key axes are the TOPK_ENABLED x TOPP_ENABLED
#   constexpr pair. BATCH_SIZE remains a plain TTIR runtime argument. Each
#   combo runs once at C=1 and, when the profile permits it, in one C=3 burst:
#   live cold-cache validation showed the repeated dispatch is needed to
#   materialize every combo reliably, but it must not require a second cache
#   class. The resulting combos are verified as an observable postcondition.
#   (The second family from the same incident,
#   _compute_global_topk_indices_and_lens_kernel's pointer-alignment keys,
#   is closed engine-side by #135's do_not_specialize_on_alignment fix and
#   needs no request-side arms.)
#
# Non-fatal by design: the cost of a missed shape is a mid-serve JIT (what this
# script exists to reduce), not an outage — the launcher must treat a warmup
# failure as WARN, never as a boot failure. Pair with a persistent
# TRITON_CACHE_DIR so each bucket is compiled once per image, not once per boot.

# Usage: boot-shape-warmup.sh [base_url] [model]

#                              ladder completions, seconds (default 240 —
#                              first-ever boot pays real compiles here)
#   DSPARK_WARMUP_BEARER       bearer handed over by the launcher (first parsed
#                              DSPARK_API_KEYS key, else VLLM_API_KEY); preferred
#                              over VLLM_API_KEY. Never logged by this script.
#   VLLM_API_KEY               added as Bearer auth when non-empty and no
#                              DSPARK_WARMUP_BEARER was provided
#   DSPARK_WARMUP_MAX_CONCURRENCY
#                              resolved --max-num-seqs from the launcher
#                              (default 6); C=1/2/3/4/6 arms above it are skipped
#   DSPARK_WARMUP_TRITON_CACHE_DIR
#                              host path of THIS node's persistent Triton cache
#                              (launcher derives it from HF_CACHE when
#                              TRITON_CACHE_DIR sits on the HF volume). Used
#                              only by the sampler-cache postcondition; empty
#                              or missing dir skips that check with a note.
