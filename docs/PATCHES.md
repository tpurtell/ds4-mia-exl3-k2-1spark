# Patch 1 & Patch 2 — detailed reference

Both patches live in the DSpark vLLM overlay and together make `--max-num-seqs > 1`
**correct** under vLLM-v1 continuous batching. Single-stream and uniform-static
batches keep the original code path (byte-identical).

Files changed:

| file | + | − | role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `vllm/v1/spec_decode/dspark_proposer.py` | 158 | 10 | draft loop, slot map, ragged context (Patch 1+2+2b) |
| `vllm/models/deepseek_v4/nvidia/dspark.py` | 110 | 12 | persistent KV store (`store_main_kv`), `prefill_main` |
| `vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py` | 10 | 0 | thread `req_ids` into `propose()` |

## Patch 1 — request-stable KV slot

### Symptom
At `max_num_seqs>1`, draft acceptance collapsed toward 0 (garbage drafts), even
though nothing crashed — the engine silently degraded to single-stream quality.

### Root cause
DSpark's draft keeps one persistent cross-step tensor per attention module —
`DeepSeekV4DSparkAttention.main_kv_cache`, shape `[max_num_seqs, window, head_dim]`
— a per-row **ring buffer** holding each sequence's sliding-window KV history. It
was read/written by **batch-row position** (`main_kv_cache[:batch_size]`). The
draft proposer carried **no request identity**.

Under vLLM-v1 continuous batching the running set is *condensed* whenever a request
finishes (a later request is moved into the freed row). The model's persistent
`main_kv_cache` row is **not** moved with it, so after a condense a request reads a
ring buffer that belongs to a **different** request → corrupted draft context →
acceptance collapse. (Single-stream never condenses row 0, which is why it worked.)

### Fix
Key the persistent cache by a **stable per-request slot** instead of batch row:

- `dspark_proposer.py`: add `self._req_id_to_slot: dict[str,int]` and
  `self._free_slots`. `_row_to_slot(req_ids)` reclaims slots of finished requests,
  assigns a free slot (lowest-first) to new ones, and returns the slot per row in
  `req_ids` order. A persistent, cudagraph-captured `_draft_slot_index_buffer`
  carries the slots into the graphed draft read path.
- `dspark.py`: `store_main_kv` and `forward_dspark` index the cache by
  `slot_index` (gather `index_select` on read, scatter `index_copy_` on write)
  instead of `[:batch_size]`.
- `gpu_model_runner.py`: pass `req_ids=self.input_batch.req_ids` into `propose()`
  (only for the DSpark proposer).

### Why it's safe
The math is unchanged — it only re-routes which physical row a request uses. When
the computed permutation is identity (a genuine single-request-at-a-time server
always gets slot 0), the code takes the **original in-place write path,
byte-for-byte**. Gating is on the *permutation identity*, not on `batch==1`, so the
"batch condenses to one surviving request holding a non-zero slot" case stays
correct.

---

## Patch 2 — ragged context path

### Symptom
Under real (independent / staggered) arrivals at `max_num_seqs>1`, the server
returned HTTP 500:

```
ValueError: DSpark currently requires uniform flattened per-request inputs;
got 41 rows for batch_size=2.   (dspark_proposer.py: _view_by_request)
```

### Root cause
`prepare_context` reshaped the flat target hidden states into a **rectangular**
`[batch, seq, H]` via `_view_by_request` / `_positions_by_request`, asserting every
request contributed the **same** number of rows. With chunked prefill (required —
disabling it needs `max_num_batched_tokens >= max_model_len`, infeasible at long
context) a single step **mixes prefill and decode** rows, so per-request row counts
differ (e.g. "41 rows for batch_size=2" = one request prefilling alongside one
decoding). Rectangular reshape is impossible → crash. The static benchmark passed
only because all prompts were identical length (uniform).

### Fix
Make the context path **ragged** using `query_start_loc` (per-request segment
offsets) — the same mechanism `_trim_rejected_target_context` already used:

- `dspark_proposer.py` `prepare_context`: detect non-uniform segment lengths
  (`ragged = len(set(seg_lengths)) != 1`). In the ragged branch, skip the
  rectangular view; compute each request's draft anchor with a flat index
  `anchor_idx = starts + clamp(len - rejected - 1, 0, len-1)` and
  `index_select` the per-request last hidden/positions. Pass the flat hidden +
  `query_start_loc` + `slot_index` to `prefill_main`.
- `dspark.py`: `store_main_kv(..., query_start_loc=...)` dispatches to a new
  `_store_main_kv_ragged` that loops requests via `query_start_loc`, truncates each
  segment to the last `window_size` rows, computes `slots = positions % window`,
  applies the rejected-suffix mask, and `index_copy_`s into that request's slot.
  `prefill_main` threads `query_start_loc` through and skips the rectangular view in
  ragged mode.

### Why it's safe
Storage is **position-addressed** (`positions % window`), so it never needed
uniform lengths — only the intermediate rectangular view did. When lengths are
uniform (`query_start_loc is None` / static / single-stream) the original
rectangular fast-path runs unchanged. Ragged/mixed steps run **eager** (mixed steps
are never cudagraph-captured), so dynamic Python loops / variable shapes are safe;
the uniform decode-only graphed path is untouched.

### Scope
Only the `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1` path was made ragged (the path
used in serving). The legacy `_trim_rejected_target_context` path still assumes
uniform. **Run with `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`.**

---

## Patch 2b — ragged detection independent of rejection

### Symptom (found by the GSM8K quality eval)
After Patch 2, a prefill-heavy step with **no rejection** still 500'd:
`ValueError: ... got 166 rows for batch_size=3` at `_view_by_request`. Earlier
staggered tests (uniform-ish prompts) missed it; GSM8K's varied prompt lengths hit
it.

### Root cause
Patch 2 computed `ragged` **only inside** `if gpu_mask and num_rejected_tokens_gpu
is not None`. On steps with no rejection (`num_rejected=None`, e.g. fresh requests
prefilling), detection was skipped and the code fell through to the rectangular
`_view_by_request` → crash. Raggedness depends on `query_start_loc` segment lengths,
**not** on rejection.

### Fix
- Enter the detection/ragged branch whenever `_gpu_rejected_context_mask` is on,
  **regardless of `num_rejected_tokens_gpu`** (which may be `None`).
- In the ragged anchor, default `rejected` to zeros when `num_rejected_tokens_gpu is
  None`. `_store_main_kv_ragged` already handled `None` (no masking).

### Validation
GSM8K N=8 (200 Q) — the load that crashed pre-fix — now completes with **0 errors**,
93.5% accuracy vs 95.0% sequential, **97.5% per-question agreement** (quality-neutral
within batch FP-nondeterminism).

## Issue #21 — `encode_arguments_to_dsml` corrupts dict tool arguments

### Symptom
Multi-turn tool calling fails after the first successful tool turn: prior assistant
tool calls are re-encoded into the prompt with a single wrapped `arguments`
parameter instead of the real keys. The model then imitates that corrupt history.

### Root cause
HF checkpoint `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py` always does `json.loads(tool_call["arguments"])`.
When `arguments` is already a `dict` (common in OpenAI-compatible replay),
`json.loads` raises and the `except` path wraps it as `{"arguments": <dict>}`.

Upstream: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py` (same
bug in the Keys abliterated snapshot). Not a vLLM recipe weights bug.

### Fix
Dispatch on type before parsing; keep the wrap only for non-JSON strings.
Applied at container boot after encoder install via
`patches/hotfix-encoding-dsv4-issue21.py` (mounted at
`/opt/hotfix-encoding-dsv4-issue21.py`).

### Test

## Issue #22 — `nvfp4_ds_mla` long-context decode regression

### Symptom
With `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4_ds_mla` (the recipe default), decode throughput
drops to ~1 tok/s at 600K+ context, while `fp8_ds_mla` maintains ~17 tok/s at
the same context length. Short-context throughput (~66 tok/s) is unaffected.

### Root cause
`flashmla_sparse.py` line 880 dispatches `nvfp4_ds_mla` to the slow
`_forward_bf16_kv` kernel path instead of the fast `_forward_fp8_kv` path.
The584-byte KV layout is identical for both dtypes on DSV4; only the kernel
dispatch differs.

```python
# Line 880 in flashmla_sparse.py
use_fp8_cache = self.kv_cache_dtype == "fp8_ds_mla"
# nvfp4_ds_mla → False → slow _forward_bf16_kv (~1 tok/s at 600K)
# fp8_ds_mla   → True  → fast _forward_fp8_kv (~17 tok/s at 600K)
```

### Fix
```python
use_fp8_cache = self.kv_cache_dtype in ("fp8_ds_mla", "nvfp4_ds_mla")
```

### Hotfix for running containers
```bash
docker exec <container> bash /path/to/hotfix-nvfp4-ds-mla-issue22.sh
# Then restart the vLLM process inside the container.
```

### File changed

## Issue #52 — trailing assistant turn closes with EOS (no-op loop)

### Symptom
An agent harness gets stuck emitting empty turns: 1-2 generated tokens with
`finish_reason: "stop"`, no tool call, fragments of hallucinated markup
(`<result observation="no-op"></content>`, stray `</parameter>`). During a live
incident 6 of 37 requests generated ≤10 tokens, all `stop`, zero `length`.

### Root cause
`render_message()` (HF checkpoint `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py`, installed as
`vllm/tokenizers/deepseek_v4_encoding.py`) appends the generation header only
when the trailing message is `user` or `developer`. A request whose `messages`
ends with an **assistant** message is closed with EOS and gets no header, so
the prompt ends on a bare EOS and the model generates from a dead state.
Self-sustaining: the harness records the empty turn, so the next request is
also assistant-final.

### Fix
Widen the separate generation-header transition condition to also match only
the final assistant message
(`patches/hotfix-dsv4-assistant-final-continuation.py`). The checkpoint encoder
has no `add_generation_prompt` input; the patch preserves the closed assistant
turn, then appends a fresh generation header. Reopening the turn with `wo_eos`
was measured worse (1-token empty generation on a complete turn) and is not
used. Runs after the entrypoint copies the encoder into place.

### Extension — trailing `latest_reminder` annotation (Issue #120)
A harness retry can append a trailing `latest_reminder` message after the
re-sent partial assistant turn. The reminder defeats the fix above: stock
closes the assistant turn with EOS, renders the bare reminder after it, and
the prompt still ends with no generation header — a dead state the model
escapes with immediate EOS or hallucinated markup. Verified on the real
checkpoint encoder (`encoding_dsv4.py`, snapshot `9e165c30`): a
reminder tail directly after `user`/`developer` already ends inside the
pending generation slot — the checkpoint emits
`ASSISTANT_SP_TOKEN` + thinking token *before* such a reminder — so those
tails are correct as-is.

The transition condition is therefore widened by exactly one more clause: a
**final** `latest_reminder` whose immediate predecessor is an **assistant**
message gains one fresh generation header appended after the reminder content
(thinking mode `<｜Assistant｜><think>`, chat mode `<｜Assistant｜></think>`).
Reminder tails after user/developer, reminders mid-transcript, task-precedence
rendering, and every assistant-final shape are byte-identical to the
pre-extension hotfix behavior; the post-write self-check additionally fails
closed if a patched encoder double-headers a user→reminder tail.

### Flag (default OFF = stock)
| value | behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` / unset / anything ≠ `1` | stock renderer; patcher mounted/synced to the worker but **never invoked** |
| `1` | patcher runs at container boot, chained with `\|\| exit 1` |

Fail-closed when ON: missing encoder file, missing anchor, or a failed
post-write self-check (patched module must import and render a
trailing-assistant transcript with a generation header and an
assistant-plus-trailing-`latest_reminder` transcript with one fresh header,
without appending a second header to a user→reminder tail) → nonzero exit,
boot aborts; a failed self-check **restores the original file bytes** first. An
already-patched encoder is re-validated (idempotent), never double-patched.

### Evidence status
Render/no-regression evidence is from prior head `f08cd6c`. The measured
positive-path evidence is a causal one-prompt A/B via `/v1/completions`:
trailing turn left open → 183 tokens, coherent continuation; closed with EOS →
400 tokens of raw `<|DSML|tool_calls>` markup emitted as text. **No rescue
claim**: the live no-op-loop defect did not reproduce in that session, so no
measured stuck-harness recovery exists.

A first gated-ON boot on `d4b31daf` failed closed before serving because a
review-requested guard named the nonexistent checkpoint variable
`add_generation_prompt`; the original encoder bytes were restored. Corrected
code commit `0864014` then passed serialized live proof on both ranks. OFF:
effective flag `0`, no patch marker, and the assistant-final render ended on
EOS. ON: effective flag `1`, both ranks logged `patched and verified`, and the
same 98 stock token IDs were preserved with exactly
`<|Assistant|><think>` appended. A live continuation completed with
`alpha beta`. Re-running the patcher on both ranks reported
`already applied and verified`. A deliberate anchor-drift boot exited `1` on
both ranks, entered restart/failure state, and never served the API.

Extension evidence is CPU-only so far: the patched patcher was applied to a
copy of the real checkpoint encoder (snapshot `9e165c30`) and a 16-case
render matrix confirmed the fixed shape gains exactly one fresh header while
every other shape stays byte-identical to the pre-extension hotfix. **No live
serving validation of the reminder-tail rescue exists yet** — run the same
gated-ON/OFF boot proof on both ranks before relying on it in production.

## Issue #138 — type-less assistant `output_text` history replay

### Scope and source identity

The Anemll 0.1.1 image contains vanilla vLLM commit
`752a3a504485790a2e8491cacbb35c137339ad34` at this serving boundary. The
pinned file is:

```text
/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/vllm/entrypoints/openai/responses/protocol.py
Git blob ba8bc5a40f1bcffe8073cfdb4f0a8995da5e02e4

```

`patches/hotfix-vllm-issue138-responses-history.py` locks the complete validator
method plus the surrounding `ResponseInputOutputItem` alias and request `input`
field. A version string alone is not accepted.

### Compatibility transformation

With `DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE138_RESPONSES_HISTORY_COMPAT=1`, and only then, this
reported replay item:

```json
{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"hello"}]}
```

receives only the missing item-level `"type":"message"`. It is then handed to
the pinned validator's existing assistant-output branch, which supplies only
missing `id`, `status`, and `annotations`. Supplied `id`, `status`, `phase`,
`annotations`, `logprobs`, text, optional model fields, list position, and all
other input items are preserved.

The exception requires a **missing** `type` key, assistant role, a content list
of length exactly one, and one dictionary part with `type=output_text` and a
string `text`. The singleton rule is required: pinned downstream conversion
reads `content[0]`, so newly accepting type-less multipart content could drop
parts. Explicit null/empty/unknown types, multipart or mixed content, missing or
non-string text, refusals, non-assistant roles, malformed id/status/annotations,
tools, reasoning, and other typed items retain stock acceptance or rejection.
Canonical replay remains the complete output item:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "id": "msg_...",
  "status": "completed",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type":"output_text","text":"hello","annotations":[]}]
}
```

Clients that can emit this canonical form should continue to do so. The hotfix
is compatibility behavior, not a new canonical schema, and it does not alter
Chat Completions, response storage, `previous_response_id`, tools, reasoning,
tokenization, scheduling, or model output.

### Gate, transaction, and removal

| value | behavior |
|---|---|
| unset / `0` / anything other than exact `1` | stock bytes and stock `/v1/responses` validation; patcher not invoked |
| exact `1` | both TP containers atomically apply or idempotently verify the exact postimage before engine exec |

The patcher stages in the target directory, preserves mode, flushes and fsyncs,
uses `os.replace`, re-reads the published bytes, rechecks the exact source
state, and compiles again. Missing targets, source drift, duplicate/mixed/partial
states, invalid UTF-8, compile failures, or publication errors exit nonzero. A
post-publication failure atomically restores and verifies the original exact
bytes and mode. Compose uses `|| exit 1`; neither rank has a masked path to
engine exec. Recreate both containers when changing the flag in either
direction because restart cannot unpatch an existing writable layer.

Remove the flag, mount, patcher, focused tests, verifier, and this compatibility
text together when a future pinned image contains a merged upstream fix that
accepts the exact raw singleton fixture with the same rejection boundary.

CPU contracts:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-issue138-responses-history-hotfix.py
python3 scripts/test-issue138-responses-history-live.py
```

Live stock/enabled commands are in the README. No live A/B result is claimed by
this implementation commit; the mode-strict two-turn run is the release gate.

## Codex `agent_message` Responses history compatibility

`patches/hotfix-vllm-codex-agent-message.py` source-locks the complete pinned
`ResponsesRequest.input_item_parsing` method by SHA-256, plus the surrounding
input union guards. It accepts either the stock method or the exact issue #138
postimage and is invoked after issue138, so either opt-in can run alone. The
issue138 patcher also recognizes the exact combined postimage; rerunning the
configured issue138-then-Codex order on one writable layer is byte-idempotent.

With `DSPARK_ENABLE_CODEX_AGENT_MESSAGE_COMPAT=1`, the patch converts only an
`agent_message` with non-empty string `id`, `author`, and `recipient`, exactly
one content part containing string `type=input_text` and `text`, and either no
internal metadata or the evidenced `turn_id` / numeric `create_time`
dictionary. The result contains only `type=message`, `role=assistant`, and the
original one-part content list. Extra or missing keys, empty, multipart, or
malformed content, altered metadata, and all unknown types remain unchanged for
stock Pydantic validation and therefore retain the prior rejection behavior.

The conversion irreversibly drops `id`, `author`, `recipient`, and internal
chat metadata. The model sees the text as assistant conversation history, but
cannot recover routing or attribution. Do not enable this compatibility layer
when those fields must be available to the model for audit or routing logic.

The patcher uses the same atomic publish, mode preservation, fsync,
post-publication verification, atomic rollback, and `--status` behavior as the
issue138 patch, without importing vLLM or GPU dependencies. CPU verification:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-codex-agent-message-compat.py
python3 scripts/test-python-hotfix-failclosed.py
```

Recreate both containers after toggling the flag; a restart does not revert a
patched writable layer.

## Issue #141 — sparse-MLA verify-decode chunking workaround (default OFF)

### Evidence and scope

Issue #141 is a **stochastic** TP=2 engine death sampled inside FlashInfer's
SM120 sparse-MLA paged-attention fallback; the pinned revision (`0472b9b3`)
routes calls of at most 64 rows to its standalone DSv4 decode kernel instead.
On one reporting pair, splitting at 64 survived 3,145,728 generated tokens
while a 65-row split failed in the first comparison round; the second failing
pair has **not** repeated that A/B, and the live TP/stream mechanism remains
unknown. This is an opt-in path-avoidance **workaround**, not a root-cause
fix: the fixed 64 is the pinned kernel dispatch boundary, not a deployment
concurrency threshold.

### Target and semantics

`patches/hotfix-dsv4-issue141-sparse-mla-decode-chunk.py` runs before vLLM is
imported and edits only the installed Anemll adapter method:

```
/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/vllm/models/deepseek_v4/nvidia/flashinfer_sparse.py
DeepseekV4FlashInferSM120Attention._forward_decode
```

Calls with at most 64 rows retain one call with the original unsliced objects.
Larger calls run sequential, monotonically increasing `slice` views of at most
64 rows. Exactly six row-coupled arguments are sliced together: `query`,
`sparse_indices`, `out`, `swa_topk_lens`, and the optional
`extra_sparse_indices` / `extra_sparse_topk_lens`. Both KV-cache objects,
workspace, sinks, scale, and layout remain shared by identity. Each inner call
writes a disjoint view of the existing output; no `clone`, `cat`, contiguous
copy, output replacement, retry, stream change, or generic FlashInfer wrapper
is introduced.

The patcher locks the **entire** pinned Anemll `_forward_decode` method,
including its overlay-only `_pad_decode_sparse_indices` call. It also requires
the load-bearing fragments of the pinned FlashInfer `_core.py` and
`_sparse_mla_sm120.py`: the 64-row workspace cutoff, the sliced SM120 call
signature, `_DECODE_MAX_TOKENS = 64`, the DSv4 decode dispatch predicate, and
the custom-op mutation contract that excludes both caches. An exact old method
applies once; an exact new method is recompiled and reverified without a
write. Missing, duplicate, mixed, partial-marker, SM100-like, or drifted
source is rejected.

Before publication the complete updated adapter source is compiled. Publication
uses a mode-preserving same-directory temporary file and `os.replace`; committed
bytes, mode, marker state, and syntax are checked afterward. Any failure after
the rename atomically restores and verifies the original bytes before returning
nonzero. The enabled Compose gate is chained with `|| exit 1`, so incompatible
source never reaches `exec vllm`.

### Enablement and rollback

| value | behavior |
|---|---|
| unset, `0`, or anything other than exact `1` | patcher is not invoked; installed adapter bytes remain stock |
| exact `1` | validate pinned sources, atomically apply or reverify, and fail boot closed on any error |

Enable in the authoritative `.env.dspark`:

```bash
DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE141_SPARSE_MLA_CHUNK=1
./stop-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh
./start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh
```

The launcher reports the resolved 0/1 state and syncs the selected patch source
to the worker; both rank entrypoints receive the same normalized flag and run
the same source preflight. Check both rank logs for `applied and verified` (or
`already applied and verified`) and then make a real generation request with a
terminal `finish_reason`. `/health` alone is insufficient: it remained 200 in
reported stalled/silently truncated incidents.

Rollback by setting `0` (or removing the variable), then run the same paired
stop/start flow. A process restart or `docker compose restart` is **not** a
rollback: the modified site-packages file remains in that container's writable
layer. Recreating both containers restores immutable image bytes.

### Validation status and remaining gates

The committed CPU suite freezes the pinned method and guard digests, exercises
exact apply/idempotence/drift/atomic rollback, and executes the injected block
against shared-backing fake tensors across the 1–576 boundary row matrix in
SWA-only and compressed-cache shapes. It also checks exact-1 fail-closed
Compose ordering and worker wiring.

The initial live TP=2 campaign at pre-trim head `890d9de` covered
pinned-image apply/boot on both ranks, short concurrency-16 generation, and
post-run smoke and restore. Before relying on the workaround, close the
outstanding gates: disposable pinned-image
extraction plus SM121a numerical/CUDA-graph tests, a two-rank OFF/ON/drift boot
proof, and repeated stochastic generation soaks verifying terminal
`finish_reason`, rank stability, throughput, and peak scratch memory. The
second failing pair still needs the 64/65 comparison; one clean burst cannot
close a stochastic issue.

## Issue #136 — XGrammar accepts speculative tokens after termination

### Symptom and source fix

With DSpark MTP, `structural_tag` constraints, async scheduling, and TP=2,
one accepted draft batch can contain a terminating token followed by speculative
tokens. Pinned vLLM `752a3a504` passes those trailing tokens to an already
terminated XGrammar matcher. The characteristic warning is `The matcher has
terminated ... but is trying to accept new token`; the affected request can
then stop making progress and eventually end in the generic 1,800-second
`sample_tokens` RPC timeout. Raising or lowering that deadline does not repair
the grammar state machine.

`patches/hotfix-vllm-issue136-xgrammar-termination.py` backports only the three
`XgrammarGrammar` method hunks from upstream vLLM PR
[#52805](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/52805), merge
`12f64b39d29282437e35be9aa5db432fb2a1a6e6`:

- `accept_tokens` stops at the terminating token, counts it, caches termination,
  ignores the rest of that batch, and treats a later acceptance as a successful
  no-op;
- `validate_tokens` stops at termination, rolls back only the accepted prefix,
  and returns no speculative drafts after cached termination;
- `reset` clears the matcher, counter, and cached termination flag.

This is disjoint from the existing #44993 grammar-advance backport:
`hotfix-dsv4-grammar-advance.sh` changes only
`v1/structured_output/__init__.py` and `v1/core/sched/scheduler.py`; issue #136
changes only `v1/structured_output/backend_xgrammar.py`.

### Compatibility and exact identities

Enabled mode accepts only all of the following:

- image `ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1@sha256:a83948492cf13df455170fb42885f5ef4db54fefe0feff0f841ecbff464ac9d8`;
- installed metadata `vllm==0.25.2.dev0+g752a3a504.d20260714` and
  `xgrammar==0.2.3`;
- stock target SHA-256
  `231f6b9d7dab5e8d68aba486fa5912db99f8bdd3f9d8842ee3e0bb12bdb7cb67`
  (12,699 bytes), or exact post-image SHA-256
  `6c7e23c0ae5c6836d0d56862c6e825c49727fa2409b881b44ea2526f1fd03f04`
  (12,983 bytes).

Anything else—including another vLLM/xgrammar version, a symlink, partial
application, or drift before/inside/after the method region—is incompatible.
No source is written. An exact stock file is completely constructed and
compiled in memory, staged beside the target, and published with one atomic
rename. Mode/owner/group are retained and the file plus directory are fsynced.
Any post-publication read/hash/metadata/compile failure atomically restores and
verifies the original bytes. An exact post-image is reverified without a write.

### Flag and status

| value | behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` / unset / anything other than exact `1` | patcher is not invoked; installed vLLM bytes remain stock |
| `1` | worker and head compatibility checks must both pass before either rank starts; each container then applies/reverifies fail-closed before `exec vllm` |

The supported launcher syncs the patcher to the worker's canonical `patches/`
path. Direct Compose starts retain the per-container fail-before-exec gate but
do not provide the launcher's cluster-wide two-rank preflight.

Nonmutating check (stock or patched exits 0; incompatible exits 2):

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.dspark -f docker-compose.dspark.yml run \
  --rm --no-deps --entrypoint python3 vllm-dspark \
  /opt/hotfix-vllm-issue136-xgrammar-termination.py --check
```

Running-container status (`patched` exits 0, `stock-compatible` exits 1,
`incompatible` exits 2):

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.dspark -f docker-compose.dspark.yml exec \
  vllm-dspark python3 \
  /opt/hotfix-vllm-issue136-xgrammar-termination.py --status
```

### CPU and live acceptance

The hermetic fixture/transaction/startup suite requires no vLLM, xgrammar,
torch, Docker, GPU, or network:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-issue136-xgrammar-termination.py
```

Issue closure still requires a maintenance-window canary on the exact two-node
async/TP=2/MTP5 lane. After enabling only
`DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE136_XGRAMMAR_HOTFIX=1` and recreating both ranks, run:

```bash
VLLM_API_KEY='...' python3 scripts/verify-issue136-xgrammar-live.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1 \
  --model deepseek-v4-flash-dspark \
  --output /tmp/issue136-xgrammar-live.json
```

The verifier uses a 120-second deadline per request and records no credentials,
headers, request bodies, or response bodies. It runs 20 sequential strict tool
requests; 100 at concurrency four alternating required/named tool choice; five
bounded strict-JSON `ignore_eos` diagnostics; ten ordinary-tool controls; and
ten plain-chat controls. Require all 145 cases plus pre/post `/health` to pass.
From the same saved UTC start time, both rank logs must contain zero matcher
termination warnings, `Failed to advance FSM`/`grammar rejected tokens`, shared
memory broadcast-block waits, `sample_tokens` timeouts, and
`EngineDeadError`/`EngineCore encountered an issue`; restart counts must remain
unchanged and no request may remain running with frozen generation progress.
The JSON request report alone is not the complete live gate.

### Rollback and upgrade

Changing the flag requires a real two-node stop/removal and start. To roll back,
set the flag to `0`, require `stop-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh` to remove both
service containers, then start normally. `docker restart` or restarting the
process reuses the patched writable layer and is **not** rollback. On an image
upgrade, leave the flag off: enabled mode intentionally rejects even a newer
upstream file. Once the image incorporates PR #52805, remove this patcher,
flag, fixtures/tests, sync/preflight, and documentation together.

Evidence currently checked in is CPU/source-exact only. Do not claim the live
incident closed until the two-rank canary and log/health gate above pass.

## Issue #117 — bounded SHM dispatch-ring reader recovery

### Scope and upstream fix

The mid-serve failure addressed here is a local `MessageQueue` reader parked in
`SpinCondition.wait()` after a PUB/SUB notification is missed. The dispatch is
already authoritative in shared memory, but an indefinite socket poll prevents
the reader from checking that slot again.

`patches/hotfix-vllm-issue117-shm-ring-buffer.py` backports both changes from
upstream vLLM PR #45224, merge
`10c75477b07c2f1a361f54b7357af1019bba5fd8`:

- `ReadTimeoutWithWarnings.timeout_ms()` is capped by the upstream
  `SHM_READER_RECHECK_INTERVAL_MS = 5000`, including indefinite/no-warning
  reads, so the authoritative written flag is checked again;
- `acquire_read()` releases the reader slot, advances the ring index, and
  records the read in `finally` even when the consumer raises.

This is not an orphaned-SHM lifecycle fix. It does not enumerate, unlink, or
reuse `/dev/shm/psm_*` objects and does not claim to fix the separate
stop/start API-readiness failure associated with ownerless segments.

### Compatibility and publication

The patcher accepts only
`vllm==0.25.2.dev0+g752a3a504.d20260714` and one of four complete-file
identities: exact issue-117 stock or patched bytes, each with either the exact
stock `busy_loop_s = 1` line or the independent issue #79
`busy_loop_s = 0.002` overlay. It never changes that issue #79 line.

Marker-only, partial, mixed, duplicated, independently drifted, symlinked, and
unsupported-version states are incompatible. Compatibility checks are
unconditional under `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1`. A stock post-image is built and
compiled in memory; rollback and candidate images are staged beside the
target with retained mode/owner/group and file `fsync`, then one atomic rename
publishes the candidate. The directory and published bytes are fsynced and
re-read. Any post-publication failure atomically restores and verifies the
original bytes and metadata. An exact patched image is verified without a
write.

### Startup and rollback

The launcher syncs the dedicated patcher, checks worker then head without
mutation, and only then starts either service. Each container applies the
patcher and requires a successful `--status` before `exec vllm`.

The backport is default-on. Set
`DSPARK_SKIP_ISSUE117_RECHECK_HOTFIX=1`, then stop/remove and recreate both
service containers, to restore image stock for issue #117 without changing the
separate issue #79 spin-wait setting. A process or Docker restart reuses the
writable layer and is not rollback.

The hermetic behavior/source/transaction/startup suite is:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-issue117-shm-ring-buffer.py
```

## Item 6 — sequence-parallel Lightning indexer for long prefills (default OFF)

### Why

`DeepseekV4Indexer` is replicated across TP ranks (`wq_b` / `weights_proj` are
`ReplicatedLinear`), so every rank scores all 64 index heads against the whole
compressed key range of every prefill query. At long context that O(queries ×
keys) score is the dominant prefill cost (900K prefill ≈ 875 tok/s vs ≈ 2,500
tok/s at 2K) and it is computed once per rank. Report:
`docs/CLAUDE/fable5-1-report.md` §3.6.

### What the patch does

`patches/hotfix-dsv4-sp-indexer-prefill.py` edits
`vllm/model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer.py`. In the prefill loop, for a
chunk with at least `DSPARK_SP_INDEXER_MIN_KEYS` compressed keys (default 8192
= 32K tokens at compress ratio 4), TP rank `r`:

1. splits every request's compressed key range into `tp` contiguous,
   page-aligned slices (`_sp_indexer_split`) and gathers only its own slice
   from the paged indexer cache (shifted block table, rank-local
   `cu_seq_lens`);
2. maps each query's global `[ks, ke)` onto its local rows
   (`_sp_indexer_local_bounds`, causal bound clamped into the slice);
3. runs the stock `fp8_fp4_mqa_logits` + `top_k_per_row_prefill` on the local
   slice (half the logits, half the K gather at TP=2);
4. packs `(score, global_id)` for its local top-k, all-gathers the candidates
   across the TP group (`tp × index_topk × 8 B` per query) and runs vLLM's
   DCP `stable_topk_from_gathered_candidates_cutedsl` into the shared
   `topk_indices_buffer`.

Exactness follows the DCP argument: a token in the global top-k is in its
owning rank's local top-k, so merging local top-k sets equals top-k over the
full row. Decode, chunks below the threshold, DCP>1, TP=1 and XPU keep the
stock replicated path byte-for-byte. Control flow is symmetric across ranks
(the decision uses CPU-side chunk metadata that is identical on all ranks), so
the collective cannot desynchronize.

### Flag (default OFF = stock)

| value | behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` / unset / anything ≠ `1` | patcher not invoked; stock bytes |
| `1` | apply at boot on both ranks, `|| exit 1` (fail-closed); `DSPARK_SP_INDEXER_MIN_KEYS` tunes the threshold at runtime |

Recreate both containers when flipping (a restart keeps the patched layer).

### Validation

* CPU: `python3 tests/test_sp_indexer_prefill.py` — applies to the real image
  file, idempotent, compiles; split/bounds math vs brute force for many request
  shapes at TP 2/3/4 (page alignment, disjoint cover, per-query local range).
* GPU (inside the image, one GPU, no process group): `scripts/test-sp-indexer-gpu.py`
  runs the real kernels for emulated TP=2 and TP=3 and compares the merged top-k
  against the stock full-range path (valid-candidate counts and score multisets).
  Needs the DeepGEMM SM121 header alias below when the JIT cache is cold.
* Live A/B still required: `scripts/bench-ttft.py` at 32K–900K prompts with
  `DSPARK_ENABLE_SP_INDEXER=0/1`, plus `scripts/ruler-lite.py` for quality.

## DeepGEMM SM121 indexer-logits header alias (default OFF)

The image's vendored DeepGEMM emits `sm121_fp8_mqa_logits<...>` and includes
`impls/sm121_fp8_mqa_logits.cuh` on GB10 (CC 12.1) but ships only `sm120_*`
headers. Production works because `VLLM_CACHE_ROOT/deep_gemm/cache/` already
holds cubins built from `sm120_fp8_mqa_logits.cuh` (Jul 16 / Jul 27). A cache
miss — fresh volume, new cache root, new index head count, the fp4 indexer path
— fails at first use with `Failed to open .../sm121_fp8_mqa_logits.cuh`.

`patches/hotfix-deepgemm-sm121-mqa-header-alias.sh` (gate
`DSPARK_ENABLE_DEEPGEMM_SM121_ALIAS=1`) writes four alias headers
(`#include <deep_gemm/impls/sm120_X.cuh>` + `#define sm121_X sm120_X`) for the
fp8/fp4 × contiguous/paged mqa-logits kernels. Idempotent; `--status` reports.
Details: `docs/CLAUDE/item8-fp4-kv-design.md` §5.
