# Patch 1 & Patch 2 — detailed reference

Both patches live in the DSpark vLLM overlay and together make `--max-num-seqs > 1`
**correct** under vLLM-v1 continuous batching. Single-stream and uniform-static
batches keep the original code path (byte-identical).

## Patch 1 — request-stable KV slot

### Symptom
At `max_num_seqs>1`, draft acceptance collapsed toward 0 (garbage drafts), even
though nothing crashed — the engine silently degraded to single-stream quality.

### Root cause
DSpark's draft keeps one persistent cross-step tensor per attention module —
`DeepSeekV4DSparkAttention.main_kv_cache`, shape `[max_num_seqs, window, head_dim]`
— a per-row **ring buffer** holding each sequence's sliding-window KV history. It
was read/written by **batch-row position** (`main_kv_cache[:batch_size]`). The
draft proposer carried **no request identity**.

Under vLLM-v1 continuous batching the running set is *condensed* whenever a request
finishes (a later request is moved into the freed row). The model's persistent
`main_kv_cache` row is **not** moved with it, so after a condense a request reads a
ring buffer that belongs to a **different** request → corrupted draft context →
acceptance collapse. (Single-stream never condenses row 0, which is why it worked.)

### Fix
Key the persistent cache by a **stable per-request slot** instead of batch row:

- `dspark_proposer.py`: add `self._req_id_to_slot: dict[str,int]` and
  `self._free_slots`. `_row_to_slot(req_ids)` reclaims slots of finished requests,
  assigns a free slot (lowest-first) to new ones, and returns the slot per row in
  `req_ids` order. A persistent, cudagraph-captured `_draft_slot_index_buffer`
  carries the slots into the graphed draft read path.
- `dspark.py`: `store_main_kv` and `forward_dspark` index the cache by
  `slot_index` (gather `index_select` on read, scatter `index_copy_` on write)
  instead of `[:batch_size]`.
- `gpu_model_runner.py`: pass `req_ids=self.input_batch.req_ids` into `propose()`
  (only for the DSpark proposer).

### Why it's safe
The math is unchanged — it only re-routes which physical row a request uses. When
the computed permutation is identity (a genuine single-request-at-a-time server
always gets slot 0), the code takes the **original in-place write path,
byte-for-byte**. Gating is on the *permutation identity*, not on `batch==1`, so the
"batch condenses to one surviving request holding a non-zero slot" case stays
correct.

## Patch 2 — ragged context path

### Symptom
Under real (independent / staggered) arrivals at `max_num_seqs>1`, the server
returned HTTP 500:

```
ValueError: DSpark currently requires uniform flattened per-request inputs;
got 41 rows for batch_size=2.   (dspark_proposer.py: _view_by_request)
```

### Root cause
`prepare_context` reshaped the flat target hidden states into a **rectangular**
`[batch, seq, H]` via `_view_by_request` / `_positions_by_request`, asserting every
request contributed the **same** number of rows. With chunked prefill (required —
disabling it needs `max_num_batched_tokens >= max_model_len`, infeasible at long
context) a single step **mixes prefill and decode** rows, so per-request row counts
differ (e.g. "41 rows for batch_size=2" = one request prefilling alongside one
decoding). Rectangular reshape is impossible → crash. The static benchmark passed
only because all prompts were identical length (uniform).

### Fix
Make the context path **ragged** using `query_start_loc` (per-request segment
offsets) — the same mechanism `_trim_rejected_target_context` already used:

- `dspark_proposer.py` `prepare_context`: detect non-uniform segment lengths
  (`ragged = len(set(seg_lengths)) != 1`). In the ragged branch, skip the
  rectangular view; compute each request's draft anchor with a flat index
  `anchor_idx = starts + clamp(len - rejected - 1, 0, len-1)` and
  `index_select` the per-request last hidden/positions. Pass the flat hidden +
  `query_start_loc` + `slot_index` to `prefill_main`.
- `dspark.py`: `store_main_kv(..., query_start_loc=...)` dispatches to a new
  `_store_main_kv_ragged` that loops requests via `query_start_loc`, truncates each
  segment to the last `window_size` rows, computes `slots = positions % window`,
  applies the rejected-suffix mask, and `index_copy_`s into that request's slot.
  `prefill_main` threads `query_start_loc` through and skips the rectangular view in
  ragged mode.

### Why it's safe
Storage is **position-addressed** (`positions % window`), so it never needed
uniform lengths — only the intermediate rectangular view did. When lengths are
uniform (`query_start_loc is None` / static / single-stream) the original
rectangular fast-path runs unchanged. Ragged/mixed steps run **eager** (mixed steps
are never cudagraph-captured), so dynamic Python loops / variable shapes are safe;
the uniform decode-only graphed path is untouched.

### Scope
Only the `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1` path was made ragged (the path
used in serving). The legacy `_trim_rejected_target_context` path still assumes
uniform. **Run with `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`.**

## Patch 2b — ragged detection independent of rejection

### Symptom (found by the GSM8K quality eval)
After Patch 2, a prefill-heavy step with **no rejection** still 500'd:
`ValueError: ... got 166 rows for batch_size=3` at `_view_by_request`. Earlier
staggered tests (uniform-ish prompts) missed it; GSM8K's varied prompt lengths hit
it.

### Root cause
Patch 2 computed `ragged` **only inside** `if gpu_mask and num_rejected_tokens_gpu
is not None`. On steps with no rejection (`num_rejected=None`, e.g. fresh requests
prefilling), detection was skipped and the code fell through to the rectangular
`_view_by_request` → crash. Raggedness depends on `query_start_loc` segment lengths,
**not** on rejection.

### Fix
- Enter the detection/ragged branch whenever `_gpu_rejected_context_mask` is on,
  **regardless of `num_rejected_tokens_gpu`** (which may be `None`).
- In the ragged anchor, default `rejected` to zeros when `num_rejected_tokens_gpu is
  None`. `_store_main_kv_ragged` already handled `None` (no masking).

### Validation
GSM8K N=8 (200 Q) — the load that crashed pre-fix — now completes with **0 errors**,
93.5% accuracy vs 95.0% sequential, **97.5% per-question agreement** (quality-neutral
within batch FP-nondeterminism).

## Issue #21 — `encode_arguments_to_dsml` corrupts dict tool arguments

### Symptom
Multi-turn tool calling fails after the first successful tool turn: prior assistant
tool calls are re-encoded into the prompt with a single wrapped `arguments`
parameter instead of the real keys. The model then imitates that corrupt history.

### Root cause
HF checkpoint `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py` always does `json.loads(tool_call["arguments"])`.
When `arguments` is already a `dict` (common in OpenAI-compatible replay),
`json.loads` raises and the `except` path wraps it as `{"arguments": <dict>}`.

Upstream: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py` (same
bug in the Keys abliterated snapshot). Not a vLLM recipe weights bug.

### Fix
Dispatch on type before parsing; keep the wrap only for non-JSON strings.
Applied at container boot after encoder install via
`patches/hotfix-encoding-dsv4-issue21.py` (mounted at
`/opt/hotfix-encoding-dsv4-issue21.py`).

## Issue #22 — `nvfp4_ds_mla` long-context decode regression

### Symptom
With `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4_ds_mla` (the recipe default), decode throughput
drops to ~1 tok/s at 600K+ context, while `fp8_ds_mla` maintains ~17 tok/s at
the same context length. Short-context throughput (~66 tok/s) is unaffected.

### Root cause
`flashmla_sparse.py` line 880 dispatches `nvfp4_ds_mla` to the slow
`_forward_bf16_kv` kernel path instead of the fast `_forward_fp8_kv` path.
The584-byte KV layout is identical for both dtypes on DSV4; only the kernel
dispatch differs.

```python
# Line 880 in flashmla_sparse.py
use_fp8_cache = self.kv_cache_dtype == "fp8_ds_mla"
# nvfp4_ds_mla → False → slow _forward_bf16_kv (~1 tok/s at 600K)
# fp8_ds_mla   → True  → fast _forward_fp8_kv (~17 tok/s at 600K)
```

### Fix
```python
use_fp8_cache = self.kv_cache_dtype in ("fp8_ds_mla", "nvfp4_ds_mla")
```

### Hotfix for running containers
```bash
docker exec <container> bash /path/to/hotfix-nvfp4-ds-mla-issue22.sh
# Then restart the vLLM process inside the container.
```

## Issue #52 — trailing assistant turn closes with EOS (no-op loop)

### Symptom
An agent harness gets stuck emitting empty turns: 1-2 generated tokens with
`finish_reason: "stop"`, no tool call, fragments of hallucinated markup
(`<result observation="no-op"></content>`, stray `</parameter>`). During a live
incident 6 of 37 requests generated ≤10 tokens, all `stop`, zero `length`.

### Root cause
`render_message()` (HF checkpoint `encoding/encoding_dsv4.py`, installed as
`vllm/tokenizers/deepseek_v4_encoding.py`) appends the generation header only
when the trailing message is `user` or `developer`. A request whose `messages`
ends with an **assistant** message is closed with EOS and gets no header, so
the prompt ends on a bare EOS and the model generates from a dead state.
Self-sustaining: the harness records the empty turn, so the next request is
also assistant-final.

### Fix
Widen the separate generation-header transition condition to also match only
the final assistant message
(`patches/hotfix-dsv4-assistant-final-continuation.py`). The checkpoint encoder
has no `add_generation_prompt` input; the patch preserves the closed assistant
turn, then appends a fresh generation header. Reopening the turn with `wo_eos`
was measured worse (1-token empty generation on a complete turn) and is not
used. Runs after the entrypoint copies the encoder into place.

### Extension — trailing `latest_reminder` annotation (Issue #120)
A harness retry can append a trailing `latest_reminder` message after the
re-sent partial assistant turn. The reminder defeats the fix above: stock
closes the assistant turn with EOS, renders the bare reminder after it, and
the prompt still ends with no generation header — a dead state the model
escapes with immediate EOS or hallucinated markup. Verified on the real
checkpoint encoder (`encoding_dsv4.py`, snapshot `9e165c30`): a
reminder tail directly after `user`/`developer` already ends inside the
pending generation slot — the checkpoint emits
`ASSISTANT_SP_TOKEN` + thinking token *before* such a reminder — so those
tails are correct as-is.

The transition condition is therefore widened by exactly one more clause: a
**final** `latest_reminder` whose immediate predecessor is an **assistant**
message gains one fresh generation header appended after the reminder content
(thinking mode `<｜Assistant｜><think>`, chat mode `<｜Assistant｜></think>`).
Reminder tails after user/developer, reminders mid-transcript, task-precedence
rendering, and every assistant-final shape are byte-identical to the
pre-extension hotfix behavior; the post-write self-check additionally fails
closed if a patched encoder double-headers a user→reminder tail.

### Flag (default OFF = stock)
| value | behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` / unset / anything ≠ `1` | stock renderer; patcher mounted/synced to the worker but **never invoked** |
| `1` | patcher runs at container boot, chained with `\|\| exit 1` |

Fail-closed when ON: missing encoder file, missing anchor, or a failed
post-write self-check (patched module must import and render a
trailing-assistant transcript with a generation header and an
assistant-plus-trailing-`latest_reminder` transcript with one fresh header,
without appending a second header to a user→reminder tail) → nonzero exit,
boot aborts; a failed self-check **restores the original file bytes** first. An
already-patched encoder is re-validated (idempotent), never double-patched.

### Evidence status
Render/no-regression evidence is from prior head `f08cd6c`. The measured
positive-path evidence is a causal one-prompt A/B via `/v1/completions`:
trailing turn left open → 183 tokens, coherent continuation; closed with EOS →
400 tokens of raw `<|DSML|tool_calls>` markup emitted as text. **No rescue
claim**: the live no-op-loop defect did not reproduce in that session, so no
measured stuck-harness recovery exists.

A first gated-ON boot on `d4b31daf` failed closed before serving because a
review-requested guard named the nonexistent checkpoint variable
`add_generation_prompt`; the original encoder bytes were restored. Corrected
code commit `0864014` then passed serialized live proof on both ranks. OFF:
effective flag `0`, no patch marker, and the assistant-final render ended on
EOS. ON: effective flag `1`, both ranks logged `patched and verified`, and the
same 98 stock token IDs were preserved with exactly
`<|Assistant|><think>` appended. A live continuation completed with
`alpha beta`. Re-running the patcher on both ranks reported
`already applied and verified`. A deliberate anchor-drift boot exited `1` on
both ranks, entered restart/failure state, and never served the API.

Extension evidence is CPU-only so far: the patched patcher was applied to a
copy of the real checkpoint encoder (snapshot `9e165c30`) and a 16-case
render matrix confirmed the fixed shape gains exactly one fresh header while
every other shape stays byte-identical to the pre-extension hotfix. **No live
serving validation of the reminder-tail rescue exists yet** — run the same
gated-ON/OFF boot proof on both ranks before relying on it in production.
